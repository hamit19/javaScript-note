# javaScript-note
This is a repo to note whatever I've learned on my JavaScript learning journey
so if you're trying to learn JavaScript as well as I am, you can learn new stuff by
reading these notes, and if you've learned something new that was not mentioned in my 
notes you can help me to complete this repo together so feel free to make a pull request to add new 
notes to this one :)
